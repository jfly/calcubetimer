+X (close) button for server connect doesn't actually cancel as it should
+details buttons changed

+defaults to scramble view enabled
+complete documentation of all features

+bigcube scramble options (editable jcombobox?)
+scramble length options
+STDEV when DNF and other time
+splits are now properly ignored
+click on cube colors for color selection
+need to test server scrambles again
+ServerScrambleList probably needs to be changed, since there is now an infinite
number of scrambles (not to mention lengths)
+clients can only request scrambles of the default length
+Configuration rehaul:
	+properties files for configuration
	+improved configurationdialog speed by not remaking it everytime
	+save all options regarding scrambles (size of scramble view, type, length)
	+staticized!

+there are bugs with switching types of scramble midway through an average, how should it behave?  I decided to prompt the user, and then throw out the old scrambles
+create a modal dialog box to guify scramble type, length (optional), multislice.
 This solves these two problems:
	+options for exporting scrambles (type, length, multislice)
	+how should importing should do a better job of handling scramble types
+save size and position of both windows
