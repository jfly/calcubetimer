TODO:
-Another thing, I hope you can make the strings such as "Optimal Cross" still dynamic, I want to translate it to all Chinese. And "Verbose" for clock as well.
I tried to modify the .class file but can't make it use Chinese characters(but I succeeded to replace it with an English string with a DIFFERENCE LENGTH), so I need you do that. Many thanks.
-scramble area size incorrect after changing layout/language/profile
-return focus after editing time
-tick-tock speaks time? (darren)
-global sd
-global averages of tag
-date tag on each solve
	-switch to proper databasing solution
	
+hid the watermark on cross solutions
+centered scrambles would be nice
+pyraminx scramble view?
+Main window probably doesn't need to be that wide. Maybe if the show scramble/use keyboard checkboxes were moved to the next line where there's a lot of empty space it would be more balanced. 
-switching to 3x3x3 sometimes breaks gui
-startup error for shelley and patrick
	-memory leak for shelley?
-default frame size is bad for leyan

English and Guest dropdowns shouldn't be part of the menubar
Green circle is kinda tacky
?Optimal cross alg doesn't fit in the window. Maybe this could be a tab?
Does the generator group input field need to be so big?
Generator group input field should be adjacent to the generator group algorithms.
Show scramble, Multi-slice, and Wide notation boxes, and cube type dropdown should be more adjacent to the scramble.
New session, Clear session buttons should be adjacent to the session statistics
If there are only two tabs, Times and Sessions, they should really take up the entire frame. Don't have empty space to the right of "Sessions". 
	-Include font for mac users
	-"Add time" could be either a button at the bottom or just a click in the white space thing.
	-Multi-slice and Wide notation should not be present for a 3x3 and 2x2
	
	-Right click redo solve / get rid of scramble history?
	-New session should be accessed in the Sessions tab on the right, and not a button.
	-click button goes to highlight times, right click to get stats
	
	?Cubing History should be accessible in a menu and not displayed at all times
	?Either make the timer display a solid 3D button without text or a flat grey rectangle with text.
	?5px white space around timer section and times section

BUGS:
-obscure scramble + stackmat is broken
-stackmat still doesn't work on *every* computer
-disable alt-spacebar when timing?
